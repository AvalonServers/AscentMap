# Ascent: Frozen Hell map page thing
Can be found hosted online at https://thepiguy24.net/afhmap/  
Based on [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)  
  
The web stuff itself is located in the `site` subdir  
The script `zoomlevels.py` can be used to split a full image of the map into correctly sized tiles, but is not needed if not changing the map data (its also jank and set up badly)
